The idea with this internship project is to help company to move the page from Wix to Wordpress, put on the host domain and give the page a new fresh start.

STEPS:
1) Move the page from Wix to Wordpress
2) Redesign the page
3) User Interviews
4) Redign the page (if its neccesarily)
5) Post the page on the host domain.

Since I started a few days ago, I am still in a phase of redesigning the page.
